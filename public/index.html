                Hello, it's me</br>
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet</br>
To go over everything</br>
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing</br>
            </section>
            <section id="two">
                Hello, can you hear me?</br>
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be</br>
When we were younger and free</br>
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet</br>
            </section>
            <section id="three">
                There's such a difference between us</br>
And a million miles</br>

            <section id="four">
                Hello from the other side</br>
I must've called a thousand times</br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done</br>
But when I call, you never seem to be home</br>
            </section>
            <section id="five">
                Hello from the outside</br>
At least I can say that I've tried</br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart</br>
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</br>
            </section>
            <section id="six">
                Hello, how are you?</br>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry</br>
I hope that you're well</br>
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?</br>
            </section>
            <section id="seven">
                It's no secret that the both of us</br>
Are running out of time</br>
